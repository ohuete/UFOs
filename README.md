# UFOs
## Overview and Background
Dana is a Data Journalist who now does freelance work. She has asked me to develop a webpage for her exciting new project - UFO's! Not only was I tasked with building a webpage, but also creating an interactive page that holds Dana's article, all of the data and evidence that supports the article, and a table that stores this data. I added filters to the table to allow viewers to interact with the data and visualizations directly. 
### Tools and Resources
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Bootstrap

Here we have the table layout just as we planned for, with the image and title we wanted, along with the article and data table. The page has been styled to look slightly more chic and aesthetically interesting. 

Down below we can see the data that is included. It initially all sits there in chronological order, but the filters are included for viewers to interact with the data. Viewers can choose to filter the data by date, city, state, or shape of UFO. When they input the filter, the table will only show results based on that filter.

As you can see each filter works!

## Summary
The current webpage is pretty great so far. It has everything we want, however, there are ways we can improve and does contain some drawbacks. First, the filter only functions if we input the exact ID from the data file. For instance, if you wanted to look at Fresno or CA it would have to be spelled correctly and case sensitive. Another drawback is that viewers need to know specifically what they need to filter for. To imporve this and resolve these dilemmas, we can add filter options to the filter boxes. Something like a drop down menu that has filter options given to the viewer. Also, make it so the filter boxes are not spelling or case sensitive.
